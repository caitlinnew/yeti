      description: |-
        The Closed Freight Exchange (briefly CFE, or in German: Geschlossene Frachtenb√∂rse) is a concept of grouping TIMOCOM customers for offer publication constraints purposes. The common use case is that an offer with CUG settings will be published exclusively within the CUG in the first place. This means that it is not visible to any TIMOCOM customer which is not member of the set CUG. After a set duration of time (maybe never) it will be automatically visible to all TIMOCOM customers unless it has not been withdrawn before.

        If your company has a valid CUG contract with TIMOCOM you are able to send via the API all Closed Freight Exchange settings with the submitted offer.

        Some data elements of the request are incorrect. For example, a value is outside the boundaries of an element‚Äôs data range, or a required element is missing. In this case, the API will report an error status in the response.

        Nevertheless, the request was successfully processed (and as a result of the processing, the API told you what is wrong in the request.) It is up to you what you will do with this information. Perhaps you will give some feedback to the user and point out which part of the data he just entered caused the error.
